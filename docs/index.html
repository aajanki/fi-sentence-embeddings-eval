<p>This study compares modern sentence classification models on the Finnish language. The goal is to understand which sentence classification models should be considered as quick baselines in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks without having to resort to a long and costly training. Therefore, only publicly available pre-trained Finnish models are included in the evaluation. The models are evaluated on four datasets with sentence classification and paraphrasing tasks.</p>
<p>FinBERT attains the highest accuracy scores on all tested tasks.</p>
<h4 id="change-history">Change history</h4>
<p>22.7.2019 The initial version<br />
29.8.2019 Using macro F1 score as the evaluation metric because it makes more sense on unbalanced classification. The change makes SIF stand out even more clearly. (git commit <a href="https://github.com/aajanki/fi-sentence-embeddings-eval/tree/8eb451f6db888af6c48e931109d6d2ee0cd56ea0">8eb451f6</a>)<br />
21.9.2019 Grid search over the TF-IDF minimum document frequency. TF-IDF now beats other methods on one task. (git commit <a href="https://github.com/aajanki/fi-sentence-embeddings-eval/tree/fb5ac7bba3da7b18db444d476757cfc2363b344e">fb5ac7bb</a>)<br />
28.7.2020 Included FinBERT, dropped the multilingual BERT. Updated the eduskunta-vkk dataset to version v2. (git commit <a href="https://github.com/aajanki/fi-sentence-embeddings-eval/tree/41230ed79e84e660e9674b2b1279023df9ff23f4">41230ed</a>)</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-results">Evaluation results</h2>
<p>The evaluation consists of four classification tasks, each on a separate dataset. In two cases the task is to assign a sentence to a class (Eduskunta-VKK, TDT categories), in one case to detect if two sentences are consecutive or not (Ylilauta), and in one the task is to identify if two sentences are paraphrases (Opusparcus). See <a href="tasks.html">the task page</a> for further details.</p>
<p>The classification models can be divided in three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Models based on aggregated word embeddings: Pooled word2vec, pooled FastText, SIF, BOREP</li>
<li>Full sentence embeddings: FinBERT, LASER</li>
<li>TF-IDF as a baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>These models have been shown to perform well on English text. The aim of this investigation is to see how well they (or their multilingual variants) perform on the Finnish language. A more detailed description of the models is given on <a href="models.html">the embedding models page</a>.</p>
<p>The performance of the sentence classification models (the colored bars) on the evaluation tasks (the four panels) is shown below. The models are evaluated on test data not seen during the training. The presented accuracy scores are averages over three random initialization.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aajanki/fi-sentence-embeddings-eval">source code for replicating the results</a> is available.</p>
<h2 id="key-findings">Key findings</h2>
<p>FinBERT gives the best performance on all tested tasks, and it should be the first choice when the highest accuracy is required.</p>
<p>In some cases it might make sense to consider one the simpler models, too. The frequency weighted average of word2vec (SIF) is the second best model behind FinBERT on three tasks out of four. Forming the embedding vectors and training the classifier takes 1.5-5 times as long for FinBERT as for SIF in these experiments. The pooled word2vec is even easier to implement and still performs quite well.</p>
<p>These results reinforce the previous findings in the literature that in general word embeddings perform better better than simpler bag-of-word models (TF-IDF). SIF and the average pooled word2vec beat TF-IDF on three tasks out of four.</p>
<p>LASER, which incorporate the sentence context, performs considerably worse than FinBERT despite the similarities in the architecture. This could indicate the importance of monolingual training on the target language and show weakness on LASER’s multilingual approach.</p>
<p>The evaluation could be made more comprehensive by including more varied NLP tasks, such as question answering, natural language inference or sentiment analysis, but I’m not aware of suitable public Finnish datasets. This study compares only pre-trained models to limit the required computational effort. It would be interesting to find out how much performance improves if an embedding model is fine-tuned for the task under evaluation. This could benefit especially BERT and other advanced models.</p>
